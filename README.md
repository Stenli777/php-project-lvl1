### There are 5 games in this package:

brain-even (you should determine whether a number is even or not);

brain-calc (you should calculate an expression);

brain-gcd (you should determine the greatest common divisor);

brain-prime (you should determine whether a number is prime or not);

brain-progression (you should determine a missing number in an arithmetic progression)

You should enter 3 right answers for successful result. If you enter a wrong answer, a game will finish. You can try again after that.
